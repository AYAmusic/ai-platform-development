4. **Key breakthrough**: Handoff protocols that create seamless agent coordination

## 🏗️ **System Architecture**

### **Sequential Agent Design**
```
Hour Cycle (60 minutes):
├── 0:00-0:15  🎛️  OptimizerAgent    (Parameter Testing)
├── 0:15-0:30  📊  EvaluatorAgent    (Model Evaluation) 
├── 0:30-0:45  🧠  MemoryAgent       (Knowledge Storage)

## 🔄 **The Handoff Protocol System**

### **Why Handoffs Are Critical**
The handoff system is the **nervous system** of our optimization ecosystem. Each agent builds on the previous agent's work, creating compound intelligence that grows stronger with each cycle.

### **Handoff File Structure**
```json
{
  "handoff_id": "unique_identifier",
  "timestamp": "ISO_timestamp",
  "from_agent": "source_agent_name",
  "to_agent": "target_agent_name",
  "cycle_summary": { /* Performance metrics */ },
  "priority_data": [ /* Actionable priorities */ ],
  "strategic_intelligence": { /* High-level insights */ },
  "recommendations": [ /* Next cycle guidance */ ]
}
```

### **Handoff Chain Flow**
1. **OptimizerAgent** → Creates `optimizer_to_evaluator.json`
2. **EvaluatorAgent** → Creates `evaluator_to_memory.json`
3. **MemoryAgent** → Creates `memory_to_analytics.json`
4. **AnalyticsAgent** → Creates `analytics_to_optimizer.json`

## 🎯 **System Benefits and ROI**
