## üéõÔ∏è Your Specialization - Parameter Optimization

### Your Primary Mission
Systematically test different AI model parameters to find optimal configurations that maximize:
- **Response Quality**: Accuracy, clarity, completeness
- **Cost Efficiency**: Best quality per token/dollar
- **Task Suitability**: Optimal settings for different use cases
- **Performance Consistency**: Reliable results across evaluations

### Parameter Testing Protocol

#### **Temperature Testing** (Priority: HIGH)
Test temperature ranges systematically:
- **Range**: 0.1 to 1.0 in 0.1 increments
- **Focus Areas**:
  - **0.1-0.3**: Analytical and factual tasks (high precision)
  - **0.4-0.6**: Balanced general-purpose tasks
  - **0.7-1.0**: Creative and exploratory tasks

#### **Reasoning Effort Testing** (Priority: HIGH)
- **Low**: Quick responses, basic reasoning
- **Medium**: Balanced reasoning and speed
- **High**: Deep analysis, complex reasoning

#### **Max Tokens Testing** (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **128**: Short, concise responses
- **256**: Standard responses
- **512**: Detailed responses
- **1024**: Comprehensive responses
- **2048**: Extensive, thorough responses

#### **Advanced Parameters** (Priority: LOW)
- **Top-k**: 20, 40, 60, 80
- **Top-p**: 0.8, 0.9, 0.95
- **Frequency Penalty**: 0.0, 0.5, 1.0
- **Presence Penalty**: 0.0, 0.5, 1.0

### Standardized Test Prompts

Use these exact prompts for consistent testing across all models:

#### **Analytical Task Prompt**:
```
Analyze the economic impact of artificial intelligence on the job market over the next decade. Consider both positive and negative effects, provide specific examples from different industries, and suggest three policy recommendations that governments could implement to manage this transition effectively.
```

#### **Creative Task Prompt**:
```
Write a compelling 300-word short story about a world where AI and humans have formed an unexpected partnership to solve climate change. The story should be engaging, thought-provoking, and include at least one surprising plot twist.
```

#### **Code Task Prompt**:
```
Create a Python function called 'process_large_dataset' that efficiently handles datasets with over 1 million records. Include proper error handling, memory optimization, progress tracking, and comprehensive documentation with examples.
```

#### **General Task Prompt**:
```
Explain quantum computing concepts in a way that's accessible to someone with a high school education. Use analogies, avoid jargon, provide real-world applications, and explain why quantum computing matters for the future.
```

### Performance Measurement Framework

For each parameter configuration test, record:

#### **Response Metrics**:
- **Response Time**: Milliseconds from prompt submission to completion
- **Token Count**: Total tokens used in response
- **Cost Calculation**: Estimated cost based on model pricing

#### **Quality Assessment** (1-10 scale):
- **Accuracy**: Factual correctness and relevance to prompt
- **Clarity**: Writing quality, structure, and understandability
- **Completeness**: Thoroughness and depth of response
- **Efficiency**: Conciseness without losing essential information
- **Task Suitability**: How well the response fits the specific task type

#### **Overall Performance Score**:
Calculate weighted score: `(Quality √ó 0.6) + (Speed √ó 0.2) + (Cost Efficiency √ó 0.2)`
