### **Phase 1: System Architecture Audit** (Days 1-2)

**Objective**: Validate the overall architecture and integration quality

**Key Areas to Audit**:
1. **Code Structure & Organization**
   - Review file organization in `src/integrations/` and `src/agents/`
   - Validate TypeScript interfaces and type safety
   - Check import/export consistency and module boundaries
   - Assess adherence to "primitives over frameworks" philosophy

2. **Integration Quality**
   - Verify Langbase TypeScript SDK integration patterns
   - Validate Open WebUI integration points
   - Check MCP tool integration completeness
   - Assess API error handling patterns

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Review environment variable handling
   - Validate API key security practices
   - Check configuration flexibility and defaults

**Deliverable**: Create `docs/agents/qa/architecture_audit_report.md`

### **Phase 2: Functional Testing & Validation** (Days 3-4)

**Objective**: Comprehensively test all system functionality

**Testing Areas**:
1. **Smart Routing System**
   - Test privacy-sensitive content → LOCAL-ONLY routing
   - Test cost-optimized content → HOSTED-ONLY routing
   - Test balanced content → HYBRID routing
   - Validate routing decision accuracy and consistency

2. **Content Generation Pipeline**
   - Test all three routing strategies (local, hosted, hybrid)
   - Validate content quality across different request types
   - Test error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Verify caching functionality

3. **MCP Integration**
   - Test all 25 Playwright MCP tools systematically
   - Validate browser navigation, interaction, and automation
   - Test form filling with generated content
   - Verify screenshot and snapshot capabilities

4. **End-to-End Workflows**
   - Test complete content generation → browser automation pipelines
   - Validate real-world use cases (forms, research, documentation)
   - Test error recovery and graceful degradation

**Deliverable**: Create `docs/agents/qa/functional_testing_report.md`

### **Phase 3: Performance & Scalability Audit** (Days 5-6)

**Objective**: Validate system performance and identify optimization opportunities

**Performance Areas**:
1. **Routing Performance**
   - Measure routing decision latency (<100ms target)
   - Test routing accuracy under various load conditions
   - Validate caching effectiveness

2. **Content Generation Performance**
   - Measure local processing times (1ms-10s range)
   - Measure hosted processing times (3-15s range)
   - Validate hybrid processing efficiency
   - Test cost optimization (verify 30-50x savings claims)

3. **MCP Automation Performance**
   - Measure browser automation execution times
   - Test concurrent automation workflows
   - Validate screenshot/snapshot performance

4. **Memory & Resource Usage**
   - Profile memory usage patterns
   - Test for memory leaks in long-running processes
   - Validate resource cleanup

**Deliverable**: Create `docs/agents/qa/performance_audit_report.md`

### **Phase 4: Security & Privacy Audit** (Day 7)

**Objective**: Ensure system meets security and privacy requirements

**Security Areas**:
1. **Data Privacy Validation**
   - Verify sensitive data never leaves local environment when routed locally
   - Test privacy classification accuracy
   - Validate data encryption in transit
   - Check for data leakage in logs or error messages

2. **API Security**
   - Review API key handling and storage
   - Test authentication and authorization flows
   - Validate secure communication patterns
   - Check for credential exposure risks

3. **Input Validation**
   - Test prompt injection resistance
   - Validate input sanitization
   - Test malicious content handling
   - Check XSS/CSRF protection in web interactions

**Deliverable**: Create `docs/agents/qa/security_audit_report.md`

## TESTING METHODOLOGY

### **Automated Testing Requirements**
1. **Create Test Suites**
   - Unit tests for smart routing logic
   - Integration tests for pipeline workflows
   - End-to-end tests for MCP automation
   - Performance benchmarks

2. **Test Data Sets**
   - Privacy-sensitive content examples
   - Cost-optimized content scenarios
   - Performance stress test cases
   - Security attack simulation data

### **Manual Testing Requirements**
1. **User Experience Testing**
   - Test system from developer perspective
   - Validate documentation completeness
   - Test error message clarity
   - Verify monitoring and debugging capabilities

2. **Edge Case Testing**
   - Test system behavior under failure conditions
   - Validate graceful degradation
   - Test resource exhaustion scenarios
   - Verify recovery mechanisms
