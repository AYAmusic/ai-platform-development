# Background Agent Coordination Workflow

## WORKFLOW DESIGN

The Background Agent Coordination Workflow ensures that autonomous background agents operate efficiently, without interfering with user-facing workflows, and provide valuable insights through continuous monitoring and reporting. This workflow focuses on managing agent tasks, preventing resource conflicts, ensuring data integrity, and providing transparent progress reporting and error isolation.

**Input**: Background tasks or operational directives for agents (e.g., periodic data synchronization, health checks, new model training, log analysis).
**Process**:
1.  **Task Queuing and Prioritization**: Receive and prioritize background tasks based on urgency and resource requirements.
2.  **Resource Conflict Avoidance**: Implement mechanisms to prevent agents from interfering with each other or with active user sessions (e.g., file locks, API rate limits).
3.  **Execution and Monitoring**: Execute background tasks while continuously monitoring their performance, resource consumption, and error status.
4.  **Progress Reporting**: Provide non-disruptive updates on task progress and completion status.
5.  **Error Isolation and Recovery**: Isolate failures to prevent cascading effects and implement recovery mechanisms.
**Output**: Successfully executed background tasks, detailed reports on agent activities, resource usage, and any identified issues.

## COMPONENTS

### 1. Agent Task Queue & Scheduler
**Responsibility**: Manages the queue of background tasks for all agents and schedules their execution.
**Logic**: 
*   Prioritizes tasks based on predefined rules (e.g., critical alerts > daily reports > model retraining).
*   Distributes tasks across available agent processes/resources.
*   Handles retries for failed tasks and manages task dependencies.

### 2. Resource Conflict Manager
**Responsibility**: Prevents resource contention and ensures smooth operation across multiple agents and user activities.
**Logic**: 
*   **File Locks**: Implements a robust locking mechanism for shared files or databases to prevent simultaneous writes.
*   **API Rate Limiters**: Enforces rate limits for external API calls (e.g., Langbase) to avoid service interruptions or penalties.
*   **Resource Guards**: Monitors local resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and temporarily pauses or throttles background tasks if resources are critical for foreground user operations.

### 3. Background Task Executor
**Responsibility**: Executes individual background tasks, ensuring they run in a non-blocking and isolated manner.
**Logic**: 
*   Runs tasks in separate threads or processes where appropriate to avoid blocking the main application thread.
*   Captures stdout/stderr for logging and analysis.
*   Reports task status (started, running, completed, failed) back to the `Agent Task Queue & Scheduler`.

### 4. Progress & Reporting Module
**Responsibility**: Collects and consolidates progress information and generates reports.
**Logic**: 
*   Gathers metrics from executing tasks (e.g., percentage complete, items processed).
*   Generates weekly summary reports in `/dev_assistant_reports/` detailing agent activities, resource usage, and any significant events.
*   Provides non-intrusive notifications or updates to the user interface on background activities.

### 5. Error Isolation & Recovery System
**Responsibility**: Detects, isolates, and, where possible, recovers from errors in background tasks.
**Logic**: 
*   **Error Detection**: Monitors task execution for exceptions, crashes, or unexpected behavior.
*   **Isolation**: Ensures that a failure in one background task does not affect other tasks or the main application (e.g., using process isolation, robust error handling).
*   **Recovery**: Implements strategies for task recovery, such as retries, graceful degradation, or notification for human intervention.
*   **Alerting**: Triggers alerts for persistent failures or critical errors.

## IMPLEMENTATION

The Background Agent Coordination Workflow will involve components across various parts of the system, potentially leveraging existing Python scripts for task execution and new TypeScript modules for coordination logic within the Open WebUI application.

```typescript
// src/services/backgroundAgentCoordinator.ts

import { BackgroundTask, TaskStatus, TaskPriority } from '../types/agentCoordination';
import { generateWeeklyReport } from '../utils/reportGenerator'; // Placeholder

export class BackgroundAgentCoordinator {
    private taskQueue: BackgroundTask[] = [];
    private runningTasks: Map<string, Promise<any>> = new Map();
    private maxConcurrentTasks: number;
    private resourceMonitor: any; // Placeholder for a resource monitoring service

    constructor(maxConcurrentTasks: number, resourceMonitor: any) {
        this.maxConcurrentTasks = maxConcurrentTasks;
        this.resourceMonitor = resourceMonitor;
    }

    public addTask(task: BackgroundTask) {
        this.taskQueue.push(task);
        this.taskQueue.sort((a, b) => b.priority - a.priority); // Higher priority first
        this.processQueue();
    }

    private async processQueue() {
        if (this.runningTasks.size >= this.maxConcurrentTasks) {
            return; // Max concurrent tasks reached
        }

        const nextTask = this.taskQueue.shift();
        if (nextTask) {
            console.log(`Starting background task: ${nextTask.name}`);
            this.runningTasks.set(nextTask.id, this.executeTask(nextTask));
            await this.runningTasks.get(nextTask.id);
            this.runningTasks.delete(nextTask.id);
            this.processQueue(); // Process next task
        }
    }

    private async executeTask(task: BackgroundTask): Promise<void> {
        try {
            task.status = TaskStatus.RUNNING;
            // Simulate resource checking
            if (this.resourceMonitor.isHighLoad()) {
                console.warn(`System under high load, throttling task: ${task.name}`);
                await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000)); // Wait 5 seconds
            }

            // Execute the actual task logic (e.g., call a Python script, process data)
            // For demonstration, a simple timeout
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, task.estimatedDurationMs));

            task.status = TaskStatus.COMPLETED;
            console.log(`Completed background task: ${task.name}`);
            // Report progress/completion
            this.reportTaskProgress(task);
        } catch (error) {
            task.status = TaskStatus.FAILED;
            task.errorMessage = (error as Error).message;
            console.error(`Task ${task.name} failed:`, error);
            this.reportTaskProgress(task);
            // Implement retry logic here if applicable
        }
    }

    private reportTaskProgress(task: BackgroundTask) {
        // Logic to update UI, log, or generate reports
        console.log(`Task Progress Report: ${task.name} - Status: ${task.status}`);
        // Example: If task is a report generation, call the report generator
        if (task.name === 'Generate Weekly Summary') {
            generateWeeklyReport();
        }
    }

    // Example of resource conflict avoidance (simplified)
    public acquireFileLock(filePath: string): boolean {
        // In a real system, this would involve a robust locking mechanism
        console.log(`Attempting to acquire lock for: ${filePath}`);
        return Math.random() > 0.1; // Simulate success/failure
    }

    public releaseFileLock(filePath: string) {
        console.log(`Releasing lock for: ${filePath}`);
    }
}

```

```typescript
// src/types/agentCoordination.ts

export enum TaskStatus {
    PENDING = 'PENDING',
    RUNNING = 'RUNNING',
    COMPLETED = 'COMPLETED',
    FAILED = 'FAILED',
    THROTTLED = 'THROTTLED',
}

export enum TaskPriority {
    LOW = 1,
    MEDIUM = 5,
    HIGH = 10,
    CRITICAL = 20,
}

export interface BackgroundTask {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    priority: TaskPriority;
    status: TaskStatus;
    estimatedDurationMs: number;
    startTime?: number;
    endTime?: number;
    errorMessage?: string;
    // Add more task-specific data as needed
}
```

## ERROR HANDLING

**Graceful Degradation:**
*   If a background task fails, it should not disrupt the primary user experience. The system should log the error, potentially retry the task (with exponential backoff), and if persistent, mark the task as failed.

**Isolation of Failures:**
*   Utilize separate processes or robust `try-catch` blocks for individual background tasks to prevent a single task failure from crashing the entire coordination system or other agents.

**Resource Exhaustion Prevention:**
*   The `Resource Conflict Manager` should actively monitor system resources. If resource utilization (CPU, memory) approaches critical levels, background tasks should be throttled or paused to prioritize foreground operations, preventing system instability.

**Deadlock Detection & Resolution (for file locks):**
*   If implementing file locking, incorporate mechanisms to detect and potentially resolve deadlocks (e.g., timeouts on lock acquisition, global lock manager).

## OPTIMIZATION

**Efficient Task Scheduling:**
*   The `Agent Task Queue & Scheduler` will dynamically adjust task execution based on system load and task priority. High-priority tasks will be given precedence, and less critical tasks may be paused or delayed during peak user activity.

**Batch Processing:**
*   Where possible, combine multiple small background operations into larger batch jobs to reduce overhead and improve efficiency (e.g., processing multiple log files at once instead of one by one).

**Smart Resource Throttling:**
*   Instead of simply pausing tasks during high load, implement intelligent throttling that allows background tasks to run at a reduced capacity, rather than stopping completely, to ensure gradual progress.

**Asynchronous Operations:**
*   All network-bound or I/O-bound background operations should be asynchronous to prevent blocking the main thread and ensure responsiveness of the coordination system.

## MONITORING

**Key Metrics:**
*   **Task Completion Rate**: Percentage of background tasks successfully completed.
*   **Task Failure Rate**: Percentage of background tasks that failed.
*   **Average Task Duration**: Time taken to complete different types of background tasks.
*   **Queue Length**: Number of tasks waiting in the queue, indicating potential backlogs.
*   **Resource Utilization (by Agent)**: Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage attributed to background agent activities.
*   **API Rate Limit Hits**: Track how often external API rate limits are encountered.
*   **File Lock Contention**: Monitor the frequency and duration of file lock acquisitions and any contention issues.

**Alerting:**
*   **High Failure Rates**: Alerts for sustained high failure rates of specific background tasks or the overall agent system.
*   **Long Queue Lengths**: Alerts if the task queue grows beyond a defined threshold, indicating a bottleneck.
*   **Resource Exhaustion**: Alerts if background agents are consuming excessive system resources.
*   **Rate Limit Breaches**: Immediate alerts if external API rate limits are being hit frequently.

**Logging:**
*   Comprehensive logging of all background task lifecycle events (start, pause, resume, complete, fail) including timestamps, task IDs, and any error messages.
*   Detailed logs of resource consumption and API interactions for auditing and performance analysis.

**Reporting:**
*   **Weekly Summary Reports**: Automatically generate and store detailed weekly summary reports in `/dev_assistant_reports/`, covering key metrics, major events, and any issues encountered by background agents.
*   **Dashboard Integration**: Potentially integrate key metrics into a visual dashboard for real-time oversight of background agent operations.
