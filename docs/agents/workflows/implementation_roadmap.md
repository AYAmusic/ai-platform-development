# Implementation Roadmap: Advanced AI Agent Orchestration & Automation Workflows

## MISSION

This roadmap outlines the prioritized implementation strategy for the advanced orchestration patterns and automation workflows designed for our Enhanced Content Pipeline + MCP system. The mission is to achieve autonomous operations, intelligent coordination, and production-scale automation, transforming our hybrid AI platform into an enterprise-grade solution.

## CONTEXT

Building on the foundational work, we now have:
