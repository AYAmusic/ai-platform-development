# Knowledge Base Curator Workflow

## WORKFLOW DESIGN

The Knowledge Base Curator Workflow is designed to autonomously organize, enhance, and maintain the user's personal knowledge base on an M1 Max MacBook Pro. This workflow leverages advanced RAG capabilities and smart memory to ensure information is always up-to-date, well-connected, and easily retrievable, thereby supercharging personal knowledge management.

**Mission**: To automatically organize, enhance, and curate the user's personal knowledge base, making information readily accessible and interconnected.

**User Trigger Points**: 
*   **Automatic Ingestion**: New documents or notes added to monitored folders.
*   **Scheduled Scans**: Periodic scans of designated knowledge sources (e.g., download folder, specific project directories).
*   **Voice Command**: "Hey AI, organize my recent downloads."
*   **Text Input**: User explicitly requesting curation of a specific document or knowledge area.

**Process**:
1.  **Multi-Format Ingestion**: Ingest and process documents from various formats (PDFs, code, markdown, web pages, images with text).
2.  **Automatic Categorization & Tagging**: Intelligently categorize and tag new and existing documents based on content, context, and user's interests.
3.  **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Extract entities and relationships from documents to build and enrich the Personal Knowledge Graph.
4.  **Duplicate Detection & Merging**: Identify and resolve duplicate or highly similar content across the knowledge base.
5.  **Knowledge Validation & Curation**: Cross-reference facts, flag inconsistencies, and suggest improvements or gaps in knowledge.
6.  **Archival & Retrieval Optimization**: Optimize storage and indexing for efficient retrieval and suggest archival for less frequently accessed information.

## COMPONENTS

### 1. Multi-Format Document Ingester
**Responsibility**: Handles the ingestion and initial processing of documents from diverse formats.
**Logic**: 
*   Uses OCR for image-based documents and PDFs.
*   Parses text from various file types (e.g., `.md`, `.txt`, code files, web archives).
*   Normalizes content for further processing.

### 2. Automatic Categorizer & Tagger
**Responsibility**: Assigns relevant categories and tags to documents.
**Logic**: 
*   Uses NLP and machine learning to analyze document content and infer topics and themes.
*   Leverages `Interest & Expertise Tracking` from Smart Memory to personalize categorization.
*   Suggests relevant tags based on the `Personal Knowledge Graph` and existing categories.

### 3. Knowledge Graph Builder (Part of Personal Knowledge Graph)
**Responsibility**: Extracts entities and relationships to build and enhance the user's Personal Knowledge Graph.
**Logic**: 
*   Identifies named entities (people, organizations, concepts) and relationships between them within documents.
*   Connects new information with existing nodes in the knowledge graph.
*   Continuously updates and refines the graph based on new insights.

### 4. Duplicate Content Detector
**Responsibility**: Identifies and manages redundant or highly similar content.
**Logic**: 
*   Compares document embeddings or content hashes to find duplicates.
*   Offers options to merge similar content, archive duplicates, or link them for context.

### 5. Knowledge Quality Assurer (Extension of Enhanced RAG Workflows)
**Responsibility**: Validates the accuracy, consistency, and completeness of information in the knowledge base.
**Logic**: 
*   Cross-references facts within documents against each other and (optionally) external trusted sources.
*   Flags inconsistencies, outdated information, or potential knowledge gaps.
*   Suggests updates or areas for further research (`Continuous Knowledge Curation`).

### 6. Archival & Index Optimizer
**Responsibility**: Manages the storage and indexing of knowledge for optimal retrieval and efficiency.
**Logic**: 
*   Based on usage patterns and age, suggests archiving less frequently accessed documents to optimize active storage.
*   Ensures efficient indexing for fast and contextual retrieval by the `Contextual Retrieval Engine`.

## IMPLEMENTATION FOCUS

*   **Local-First Processing**: All sensitive personal documents will be processed and stored exclusively on the M1 Max, leveraging its local processing power for categorization, knowledge graph building, and duplicate detection.
*   **Enhanced RAG Integration**: Deep integration with the `Intelligent Document Processing` and `Advanced Search & Retrieval` components for seamless knowledge ingestion and retrieval.
*   **Smart Memory Integration**: The `Personal Knowledge Mapping` and `Interest & Expertise Tracking` components will heavily influence categorization, tagging, and knowledge discovery.
*   **Feedback Loops**: Allow users to correct miscategorizations, add/remove tags, or flag incorrect information. This feedback will be used to refine the AI models for continuous improvement.
*   **Error Handling**: 
    *   **Parsing Errors**: Gracefully handle malformed documents or unreadable content during ingestion.
    *   **Inconsistent Data**: Clearly flag factual inconsistencies detected during knowledge validation, prompting user review.
    *   **Resource Constraints**: Monitor local storage and computational resources, notifying the user if curation tasks require significant resources.

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES ADHERENCE

*   **Invisible Intelligence**: The curation process runs largely in the background, automatically maintaining the knowledge base without constant user intervention.
*   **Personal Optimization**: The knowledge base is organized and enhanced based on the user's unique interests, expertise, and usage patterns.
*   **Local-First Privacy**: All personal and sensitive knowledge remains on the M1 Max.
*   **Progressive Enhancement**: Starts with basic organization and gradually adds more sophisticated features like knowledge validation and proactive surfacing.
*   **Context Awareness**: Curation prioritizes documents relevant to the user's current projects and dynamically adapts organization based on evolving needs.

## MONITORING & VALIDATION

*   **Document Processing Rate**: Number of documents processed per unit of time.
*   **Categorization Accuracy**: Percentage of documents correctly categorized and tagged (can be manually audited on a sample).
*   **Knowledge Graph Density/Completeness**: Metrics on the number of nodes, edges, and relationships in the graph.
*   **Duplicate Resolution Rate**: Number of duplicate documents identified and managed.
*   **Knowledge Validation Flags**: Number of inconsistencies or gaps identified by the system.
*   **Search Efficiency Improvement**: Measure improvements in retrieval speed and relevance after curation.
*   **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on the ease of finding information and the overall organization of the knowledge base.
