# Personal Productivity Manager Workflow

## WORKFLOW DESIGN

The Personal Productivity Manager Workflow is designed to autonomously assist the user in task management and project planning for a single power user on an M1 Max MacBook Pro. This workflow intelligently breaks down complex projects into actionable steps, estimates timelines, and helps prioritize tasks, leveraging smart memory and context awareness to optimize daily productivity.

**Mission**: To automate task management and project planning, enabling the user to focus on execution while the AI intelligently organizes and prioritizes their work.

**User Trigger Points**: 
*   **Voice Command**: "Hey AI, help me plan [project name].", "What should I work on next?", "Add [task] to my to-do list."
*   **Text Input**: User typing project ideas or tasks into Open WebUI or a linked task management application.
*   **Contextual Trigger**: User creating a new document related to a potential project, or highlighting action items in an email/document.

**Process**:
1.  **Project/Task Ingestion**: Capture new projects or individual tasks from various input channels.
2.  **Intelligent Decomposition**: Break down complex projects into smaller, manageable sub-tasks with estimated effort and dependencies.
3.  **Prioritization & Scheduling**: Prioritize tasks based on urgency, importance, user preferences, and current context; suggest optimal scheduling.
4.  **Resource & Time Estimation**: Estimate the time and resources required for tasks, leveraging historical data and user patterns.
5.  **Progress Tracking & Adaptation**: Monitor task completion, update project status, and adapt plans based on real-time progress and delays.
6.  **Proactive Reminders & Suggestions**: Provide timely reminders, suggest next steps, and identify potential bottlenecks.

## COMPONENTS

### 1. Project/Task Ingester
**Responsibility**: Captures project ideas and tasks from diverse sources.
**Logic**: 
*   Integrates with email clients (via Playwright MCP) to identify action items.
*   Monitors text input in Open WebUI for task mentions.
*   Connects with popular task management apps (e.g., Todoist, Asana, Notion) via APIs or Playwright MCP for seamless ingestion.

### 2. Intelligent Task Decomposer
**Responsibility**: Breaks down high-level projects into actionable sub-tasks.
**Logic**: 
*   Uses AI (local or hosted) to analyze project descriptions and generate a hierarchical breakdown of tasks.
*   Estimates effort for each sub-task based on complexity and historical data from the `User Preference Engine` (e.g., how long similar tasks took the user).
*   Identifies potential dependencies between tasks.

### 3. Priority & Scheduling Engine
**Responsibility**: Prioritizes tasks and suggests optimal scheduling.
**Logic**: 
*   Applies a prioritization matrix (e.g., Eisenhower Matrix: Urgent/Important, etc.) based on user-defined criteria or inferred importance.
*   Considers user's calendar (via `Meeting & Calendar Management` workflow) and estimated task duration to suggest feasible execution times.
*   Leverages `Usage Pattern Recognition` to understand user's peak productivity hours for scheduling.

### 4. Resource & Time Estimator
**Responsibility**: Provides realistic estimates for task completion.
**Logic**: 
*   Analyzes the complexity of the task and compares it to similar tasks in the user's history.
*   Accounts for user's current workload and available focus time.
*   Can integrate with external tools for more precise resource estimation (e.g., cloud compute costs for specific coding tasks).

### 5. Progress Tracker & Adaptor
**Responsibility**: Monitors task completion and adapts project plans in real-time.
**Logic**: 
*   Tracks completed tasks via linked task management apps or explicit user input.
*   Adjusts remaining task priorities and schedules if deadlines are missed or progress is faster/slower than expected.
*   Flags potential project delays or resource overloads.

### 6. Proactive Assistant
**Responsibility**: Provides timely nudges and intelligent suggestions.
**Logic**: 
*   Sends reminders for upcoming deadlines or overdue tasks.
*   Suggests next steps for stalled projects.
*   Identifies opportunities to batch similar tasks for efficiency.
*   Learns user's preferred notification methods and frequency.

## IMPLEMENTATION FOCUS

*   **Deep Integration with User Tools**: Paramount to success. Playwright MCP will be heavily utilized to interact with various task managers, calendars, and other productivity applications on the M1 Max.
*   **Smart Memory Integration**: The `Personal Knowledge Graph` will be crucial for understanding project context and linking tasks to relevant documents. `Interaction Style Learning` will personalize how suggestions and reminders are presented.
*   **Feedback Loops**: Allow users to explicitly mark tasks as completed, provide feedback on task decomposition accuracy, and adjust priority settings. This feedback will refine the underlying AI models.
*   **Local-First Processing for Sensitive Tasks**: Any tasks involving highly sensitive personal data or financial information will be processed and managed exclusively on the M1 Max.
*   **Error Handling**: 
    *   **External API Failures**: Gracefully handle disconnections or errors with third-party task management apps. Provide clear notifications and allow for manual intervention.
    *   **Ambiguous Requests**: If a user request for task creation or project planning is unclear, ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions.
    *   **Overload Prevention**: If the system detects that scheduling additional tasks would lead to user overload, it should suggest prioritizing or deferring existing tasks.

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES ADHERENCE

*   **Invisible Intelligence**: The system works silently in the background, automatically organizing and prioritizing tasks, only interjecting with helpful suggestions or reminders.
*   **Personal Optimization**: Every aspect of task management is tailored to the user's unique work style, preferences, and productivity patterns.
*   **Local-First Privacy**: Sensitive project details and personal schedules are processed locally to maintain confidentiality.
*   **Progressive Enhancement**: Starts with basic task ingestion and gradually adds more sophisticated features like predictive scheduling and proactive bottleneck identification.
*   **Context Awareness**: The workflow understands the user's current work context (e.g., active project, meeting schedule) to provide highly relevant task suggestions and reminders.

## MONITORING & VALIDATION

*   **Task Completion Rate**: Percentage of assigned/suggested tasks completed by the user.
*   **Project On-Time Completion Rate**: Percentage of projects completed within estimated timelines.
*   **Time Savings**: Quantify the time saved by automating task breakdown, scheduling, and reminders.
*   **User Engagement**: Frequency of interaction with the productivity manager and acceptance rate of suggestions.
*   **Prioritization Accuracy**: Manual review of how well tasks are prioritized against user's stated goals.
*   **User Satisfaction**: Direct feedback on the perceived effectiveness of the productivity manager in reducing stress and improving focus.
