# Personal Research Assistant Workflow

## WORKFLOW DESIGN

The Personal Research Assistant Workflow is designed to autonomously gather, synthesize, and organize research on any given topic for a single power user on an M1 Max MacBook Pro. This workflow leverages the Enhanced Local RAG for personal knowledge management and intelligently routes between local and hosted processing based on privacy and content characteristics, ensuring efficient and private research assistance.

**Mission**: To provide intelligent, automated research assistance that enhances daily productivity.

**User Trigger Points**: 
*   **Voice Command**: "Hey AI, research [topic] for me."
*   **Text Input**: Typing a research query into the Open WebUI chat interface.
*   **Contextual Trigger**: User highlighting text in an application and selecting "Research this topic" from a context menu (requires Playwright MCP integration).

**Process**:
1.  **Query Analysis**: Understand the user's research intent, identify key entities, and determine the scope of research.
2.  **Privacy & Contextual Routing**: Analyze the query for sensitive information and the user's current project context to decide between local-first RAG or hybrid (local + hosted) web search/Langbase integration.
3.  **Information Gathering**: Execute research queries across various sources (local knowledge base, web search, specific databases).
4.  **Information Synthesis & Organization**: Process retrieved information, extract key insights, summarize findings, and organize them into a structured format (e.g., markdown, mind map, outline).
5.  **Knowledge Base Integration**: Automatically integrate new knowledge into the user's personal knowledge graph and local RAG system, linking to existing notes and documents.
6.  **Presentation**: Present the synthesized research findings to the user in a clear, concise, and actionable format.

## COMPONENTS

### 1. Research Query Analyzer
**Responsibility**: Interprets the user's research request and prepares it for information gathering.
**Logic**: 
*   Uses NLP to extract keywords, entities, and intent.
*   Identifies potential privacy implications of the query content.
*   Determines if the research is related to an ongoing project (context awareness).

### 2. Intelligent Content Router (Extension of Smart Routing Decision Workflow)
**Responsibility**: Decides the optimal research path (local RAG, web search, Langbase) based on privacy, existing knowledge, and query type.
**Logic**: 
*   If sensitive query or high confidence in local knowledge: Prioritize Enhanced Local RAG.
*   If general query or low confidence in local knowledge: Utilize web search and potentially Langbase for broader information retrieval.
*   If a blend is needed: Execute hybrid search, combining local results with external data.

### 3. Multi-Source Information Gatherer
**Responsibility**: Executes research queries across various data sources.
**Logic**: 
*   **Enhanced Local RAG**: Queries the user's personal knowledge base for relevant documents, notes, and previous research. Leverages advanced search and retrieval capabilities.
*   **Web Search Integration (via Playwright MCP)**: For external information, uses Playwright to perform targeted web searches, navigate websites, and extract relevant text and data from search results or specific pages.
*   **Langbase Integration**: For complex summarization or initial topic exploration, utilizes Langbase Pipes to leverage hosted LLMs for broad knowledge and content synthesis.

### 4. Research Synthesizer & Organizer
**Responsibility**: Processes raw information, extracts insights, and structures the findings.
**Logic**: 
*   **Summarization & Keyphrase Extraction**: Uses AI to condense large amounts of text and identify critical concepts.
*   **Fact-Checking**: Cross-references information from multiple sources to validate facts and flag inconsistencies (part of `Knowledge Quality Assurance`).
*   **Content Structuring**: Organizes findings into outlines, bullet points, or concept maps based on user preferences or detected intent.
*   **Citation Management**: Tracks the origin of all retrieved information for proper attribution.

### 5. Personal Knowledge Integrator
**Responsibility**: Incorporates new research findings into the user's existing knowledge base.
**Logic**: 
*   **Knowledge Graph Building**: Automatically identifies relationships between new research and existing knowledge, adding nodes and edges to the Personal Knowledge Graph.
*   **Document Categorization & Tagging**: Tags new documents with relevant categories and keywords for easy retrieval.
*   **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies and merges similar content to prevent redundancy.

## IMPLEMENTATION FOCUS

*   **TypeScript for Core Logic**: The main orchestration and decision-making logic will be in TypeScript, interacting with Open WebUI APIs and external services.
*   **Python for Playwright MCP**: Python scripts will be used for Playwright MCP interactions (web scraping, UI automation) due to existing Playwright Python libraries.
*   **Seamless Open WebUI Integration**: The workflow should appear as a native feature within Open WebUI, with minimal friction for the user.
*   **Smart Memory Integration**: Leverage the `User Preference Engine` to adapt routing and synthesis based on past user interactions and feedback. The `Context Awareness` component will ensure research is relevant to the user's current task.
*   **Feedback Loops**: Implement mechanisms for user feedback on research quality (e.g., thumbs up/down, direct edits) to refine the `Intelligent Content Router` and `Research Synthesizer` over time.
*   **Error Handling**: 
    *   **Source Failure**: Gracefully handle failures from web search (e.g., blocked IP, site changes) or Langbase (API errors) by falling back to alternative sources or informing the user.
    *   **Synthesis Errors**: Flag instances where the AI struggles to synthesize coherent information or finds conflicting facts, prompting user intervention or escalating to a higher-level review.
    *   **User Notifications**: Provide clear, concise notifications to the user about research progress, completion, or any issues encountered.

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES ADHERENCE

*   **Invisible Intelligence**: The user initiates the research, and the workflow handles all complexities in the background, presenting only the distilled results.
*   **Personal Optimization**: The system learns from user preferences and context, tailoring research to individual needs.
*   **Local-First Privacy**: Sensitive queries or existing local documents are processed entirely on the M1 Max, maintaining data privacy.
*   **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with core research capabilities and progressively add more advanced features like fact-checking and proactive surfacing.
*   **Context Awareness**: Research is always informed by the user's current project or application context, reducing irrelevant results.

## MONITORING & VALIDATION

*   **Research Completion Rate**: Percentage of research queries successfully completed.
*   **Information Retrieval Accuracy**: Metrics to assess the relevance and completeness of retrieved information.
*   **Synthesis Quality Score**: Automated or manual assessment of the clarity, coherence, and accuracy of synthesized findings.
*   **User Satisfaction**: Direct user feedback on the utility and quality of research results.
*   **Resource Utilization**: Monitor local CPU/memory usage during intensive research tasks.
*   **API Call Tracking**: Track Langbase API calls for cost analysis.
