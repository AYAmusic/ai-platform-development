# Smart Memory System

## WORKFLOW DESIGN

The Smart Memory System is designed to enable the AI to learn and adapt to the user's patterns, preferences, and context, providing a truly personalized and proactive productivity experience on an M1 Max MacBook Pro. This system integrates across all personal productivity workflows, acting as the central intelligence for user understanding and adaptive behavior.

**Mission**: To build a continuously learning and evolving memory system that understands user intent, adapts to preferences, and provides context-aware assistance.

**Input**: User interactions, explicit feedback, historical data (e.g., task completion, content edits, search queries), system performance metrics.
**Process**:
1.  **Data Ingestion & Event Capture**: Continuously ingest and process all relevant user interactions and system events.
2.  **Pattern Recognition & Learning**: Analyze ingested data to identify recurring patterns, preferences, and contextual cues.
3.  **Knowledge Graph Enrichment**: Build and enrich the Personal Knowledge Graph with insights derived from user interactions.
4.  **Context Maintenance**: Maintain a dynamic understanding of the user's current context (active applications, open documents, ongoing projects).
5.  **Preference Application & Adaptation**: Apply learned preferences to workflow decisions and adapt behaviors based on real-time feedback.

## COMPONENTS

### 1. User Preference Engine
**Responsibility**: Learns and applies user preferences for routing, content style, and interaction.
**Logic**: 
*   **Usage Pattern Recognition**: 
    *   Analyzes historical data from `Smart Routing Decision Workflow` (e.g., when the user prefers local vs. hosted processing for certain content types or privacy levels).
    *   Observes task completion patterns in `Personal Productivity Manager` (e.g., preferred time for deep work, task prioritization methods).
*   **Quality Feedback Integration**: 
    *   Incorporates explicit feedback (thumbs up/down on generated content, acceptance/rejection of suggestions in `Intelligent Writing Companion` and `Code Development Accelerator`).
    *   Analyzes implicit feedback (e.g., manual edits to AI-generated text, frequent re-prioritization of tasks).
*   **Interaction Style Learning**: 
    *   Adapts the AI's communication style (e.g., verbose vs. concise, formal vs. informal) based on user interactions and explicit settings.
    *   Learns preferred notification methods and frequency.

### 2. Context-Aware Response System
**Responsibility**: Adapts AI responses and workflow actions based on the user's current operational context.
**Logic**: 
*   **Active Application/Document Monitoring (via Playwright MCP)**: Understands which applications are open, which documents are active, and what content is currently in focus.
*   **Current Project Awareness**: Links active documents/tasks to known projects in the `Personal Knowledge Graph`.
*   **Adjusting Responses**: Modifies the verbosity, detail, or focus of AI responses to be highly relevant to the immediate context (e.g., if the user is in a code editor, prioritize code-related suggestions).
*   **Proactive Information Surfacing (Extension of Advanced Search & Retrieval)**: Based on context, proactively suggests relevant documents, notes, or research findings without explicit prompting.

### 3. Personal Knowledge Graph
**Responsibility**: Builds and maintains an interconnected map of the user's knowledge, interests, and relationships.
**Logic**: 
*   **Personal Knowledge Mapping**: 
    *   Extracts entities (concepts, people, projects, documents) and relationships from all ingested data (notes, emails, research, code).
    *   Continuously updates and enriches the graph with new information from `Knowledge Base Curator Workflow`.
*   **Interest & Expertise Tracking**: 
    *   Analyzes user's consumption patterns (what they read, search for), content creation (what they write about), and task focus to infer areas of interest and expertise.
    *   Uses this information to personalize content recommendations and search results.
*   **Relationship Discovery**: 
    *   Applies graph algorithms to identify unexpected or subtle connections between seemingly disparate pieces of information in the user's knowledge base.
    *   Suggests new links or organizational improvements.

### 4. Adaptive Workflow Engine (Extension of Intelligent Optimization Patterns)
**Responsibility**: Dynamically modifies workflow behaviors based on learned patterns and real-time conditions.
**Logic**: 
*   **Workflow Adjustments**: Based on `Usage Pattern Recognition` and `Quality Feedback Integration`, it can subtly adjust parameters within other workflows (e.g., change the weight of a factor in `Smart Routing Decision Workflow`, modify prompt templates for `Intelligent Writing Companion`).
*   **Predictive Optimization**: Anticipates user needs or potential issues based on historical data and proactively adjusts workflows (e.g., pre-fetching relevant documents, optimizing resource allocation before peak usage).
*   **Continuous Knowledge Curation**: Triggers the `Knowledge Base Curator Workflow` to re-analyze or optimize specific areas of the knowledge base if patterns indicate a need for better organization or completeness.

## IMPLEMENTATION FOCUS

*   **Event Sourcing for Workflow State**: Implement event sourcing to capture all user interactions and system events as an immutable log. This provides a complete audit trail and allows for state reconstruction, crucial for accurate preference learning and debugging. This also supports the `Saga Pattern` for distributed consistency. (Referenced from `ADVANCED AI AGENT ORCHESTRATION & AUTOMATION WORKFLOWS` requirement for Event-Driven Architecture).
*   **Centralized Data Store (Local-First)**: Utilize a local, high-performance database (e.g., SQLite, ChromaDB for vectors) to store the Personal Knowledge Graph, user preferences, and event logs on the M1 Max for privacy and low latency.
*   **ML Integration**: Develop and train lightweight machine learning models (on-device where possible) for pattern recognition, preference learning, and predictive behaviors. Leverage local ML frameworks optimized for M1 Max.
*   **API Exposure**: Expose internal APIs from the Smart Memory System to other personal productivity workflows, allowing them to query context, apply preferences, and contribute feedback.
*   **Feedback UI**: Design intuitive user interface elements across Open WebUI and integrated apps that allow the user to easily provide explicit feedback and correct AI behavior.
*   **Error Handling**: 
    *   **Data Corruption**: Implement robust data validation and recovery mechanisms for the local data store, leveraging event sourcing for data reconstruction.
    *   **Inaccurate Learning**: Provide mechanisms for users to explicitly correct learned preferences or behaviors if the AI misinterprets their intent.
    *   **Performance Impact**: Monitor the performance overhead of continuous learning and context awareness to ensure it doesn't degrade the user experience.

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES ADHERENCE

*   **Invisible Intelligence**: The memory system operates entirely in the background, subtly influencing workflow behavior based on learned patterns.
*   **Personal Optimization**: This is the core of the Smart Memory System, ensuring all AI assistance is deeply personalized.
*   **Local-First Privacy**: All personal data used for learning and context is stored and processed securely on the M1 Max.
*   **Progressive Enhancement**: The system starts with basic pattern recognition and progressively becomes smarter and more adaptive over time as it gathers more data.
*   **Context Awareness**: The system's primary function is to maintain and utilize a dynamic understanding of the user's current context.

## MONITORING & VALIDATION
