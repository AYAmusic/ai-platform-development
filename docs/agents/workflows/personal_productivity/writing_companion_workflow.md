# Intelligent Writing Companion Workflow

## WORKFLOW DESIGN

The Intelligent Writing Companion Workflow is designed to assist the user from idea generation to polished draft, incorporating smart routing for content creation, fact-checking, and style optimization. This workflow leverages both local and hosted AI capabilities to provide a comprehensive and personalized writing experience on an M1 Max MacBook Pro.

**Mission**: To accelerate and enhance the writing process by providing intelligent assistance, fact-checking, and style refinement.

**User Trigger Points**: 
*   **Voice Command**: "Hey AI, help me write [topic] for a [type of content]."
*   **Text Input**: User starting a new document or typing a prompt in a writing application, with the AI companion listening in context.
*   **Contextual Trigger**: User highlighting text for rephrasing, summarization, or fact-checking.

**Process**:
1.  **Idea Generation & Outline Creation**: Brainstorming and structuring initial content based on user input and intent.
2.  **Content Drafting (Smart Routing)**: Generate initial drafts, routing content creation between local and hosted models based on privacy, complexity, and user preferences.
3.  **Fact-Checking & Validation**: Verify factual accuracy of generated content against internal knowledge base and external sources.
4.  **Style & Tone Optimization**: Refine the generated text for clarity, conciseness, grammar, spelling, and adherence to a desired style or tone.
5.  **Iteration & Refinement**: Provide iterative feedback and suggestions for improvement, allowing the user to guide the writing process.
6.  **Citation Management**: Automatically track and insert citations for information sourced from knowledge bases or web research.

## COMPONENTS

### 1. Idea & Outline Generator
**Responsibility**: Assists in brainstorming and structuring the initial content.
**Logic**: 
*   Takes user input (topic, keywords, desired length, audience) and generates creative ideas, possible angles, and a structured outline.
*   Leverages the `Personal Knowledge Integrator` to pull relevant existing notes or research during brainstorming.

### 2. Smart Content Drafter (Extension of Hybrid Execution Workflow)
**Responsibility**: Generates initial text drafts, dynamically choosing between local and hosted models.
**Logic**: 
*   **Privacy-Aware Routing**: If the content involves sensitive personal information or proprietary data, prioritize local Open WebUI models.
*   **Complexity-Based Routing**: For highly creative or complex writing tasks, leverage Langbase Pipes for their advanced generation capabilities.
*   **Cost Optimization**: For simpler rephrasing or summarization, prefer more cost-effective Langbase Memory or locally optimized models.
*   Generates paragraphs, sections, or full drafts based on the outline and user prompts.

### 3. Fact-Checker & Validator
**Responsibility**: Ensures the factual accuracy of the generated content.
**Logic**: 
*   Queries the `Enhanced Local RAG` (user's personal knowledge base) and performs targeted web searches (via Playwright MCP) to verify facts.
*   Cross-references information from multiple sources and flags inconsistencies or unverified statements for user review.
*   Integrated with the `Knowledge Quality Assurance` for continuous improvement of fact-checking capabilities.

### 4. Style & Tone Optimizer
**Responsibility**: Refines the language, grammar, spelling, and overall style of the content.
**Logic**: 
*   Uses NLP techniques to analyze sentence structure, vocabulary, and readability.
*   Provides suggestions for grammar and spelling corrections.
*   Adjusts tone and style based on user preferences (e.g., formal, informal, persuasive, concise), leveraging `User Preference Engine`.
*   Can integrate with third-party grammar checking APIs or local language models.

### 5. Iteration & Feedback Loop Manager
**Responsibility**: Facilitates iterative refinement based on user input and system learning.
**Logic**: 
*   Captures explicit user feedback (e.g., acceptance/rejection of suggestions, direct edits).
*   Analyzes implicit feedback (e.g., frequency of edits, time spent on revisions).
*   Feeds this feedback back to the `User Preference Engine` and `Adaptive Workflow Engine` to continuously improve content generation and optimization.

### 6. Automated Citation Manager (Extension of Citation Manager in Hybrid Execution)
**Responsibility**: Automatically tracks and inserts citations.
**Logic**: 
*   When information is retrieved from the `Enhanced Local RAG` or web search, the source is automatically noted.
*   Citations are formatted and inserted into the generated content as appropriate.

## IMPLEMENTATION FOCUS

*   **Deep Integration with Writing Tools**: Aim for native-like integration with common writing applications (e.g., Markdown editors, word processors) on macOS via Playwright MCP or OS-level APIs.
*   **Real-time Assistance**: Provide suggestions and refinements in near real-time as the user types.
*   **Smart Memory Integration**: The `Context-Aware Response System` will understand the user's current writing project, style guide preferences, and past revisions to provide highly relevant assistance.
*   **Feedback Loops**: Implement intuitive UI elements for users to provide feedback on the quality of suggestions, directly influencing future AI behavior.
*   **Error Handling**: 
    *   **Fact-Check Ambiguity**: If fact-checking yields conflicting results or low confidence, explicitly inform the user and highlight the uncertain facts.
    *   **Grammar/Style Overcorrection**: Allow easy undo/redo for AI suggestions and learn from user rejections to avoid overcorrection.
    *   **Performance Degradation**: If local models are slow, gracefully fall back to hosted options or inform the user about the performance trade-off.

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES ADHERENCE

*   **Invisible Intelligence**: The writing companion provides assistance seamlessly in the background, only surfacing suggestions when relevant.
*   **Personal Optimization**: The system adapts its style, tone, and assistance based on the individual user's writing habits and preferences.
*   **Local-First Privacy**: Sensitive drafts or private documents are processed locally, ensuring data privacy.
*   **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with core drafting and refinement, then add advanced features like deep fact-checking and automated publishing.
*   **Context Awareness**: The companion understands the user's writing context (document type, audience, project) to offer tailored assistance.

## MONITORING & VALIDATION

*   **Drafting Speed Improvement**: Measure the reduction in time taken to complete drafts with AI assistance.
*   **Content Quality Scores**: Automated and manual assessment of grammar, clarity, and adherence to style guides.
*   **Fact-Checking Accuracy**: Percentage of facts correctly verified or flagged.
*   **User Acceptance Rate of Suggestions**: Track how often users accept AI-generated suggestions.
*   **Cost Efficiency**: Monitor Langbase API usage for content generation and fact-checking.
*   **User Satisfaction**: Gather feedback on the overall utility and perceived helpfulness of the writing companion.
