# AI Platform Development - Progress Tracker

## 🚀 Current Status: Week 1 - Foundation Assessment

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- [x] Research plan creation and documentation
- [x] GitHub repository setup and Git configuration
- [x] Project structure initialization
- [x] Basic development environment setup

### 🎯 Week 1-2 Goals: Foundation Assessment & Integration Setup

#### **Priority 1: Explore Open WebUI's Existing Capabilities**
- [ ] **Install and run Open WebUI locally**
  - [ ] Set up Docker environment
  - [ ] Test existing RAG system (Knowledge Collections)
  - [ ] Explore function calling and pipelines framework
  - [ ] Document current capabilities and limitations

#### **Priority 2: Set up Langbase SDK Integration Environment**
- [ ] **Langbase SDK Setup**
  - [ ] Create Langbase account and get API keys
  - [ ] Install Langbase SDK in development environment
  - [ ] Test basic Pipe (agent) creation and execution
  - [ ] Build simple bridge between Open WebUI and Langbase

#### **Priority 3: Prototype with Chai.new**
- [ ] **Chai.new Exploration**
  - [ ] Create account on Chai.new platform
  - [ ] "Vibe code" a simple AI agent for testing
  - [ ] Understand deployment workflow from prototype to production
  - [ ] Document integration possibilities

#### **Priority 4: Enhanced Development Environment**
- [ ] **Playwright MCP Integration**
  - [ ] Configure Playwright as MCP server
  - [ ] Test basic browser automation with Cursor
  - [ ] Validate AI-assisted development workflow
  - [ ] Create test automation examples

## 🛠️ Development Tools Setup

### **Cursor Bug Bot & GitHub Integration**
- **Status**: GitHub connected ✅
- **Next**: Configure Cursor settings for code review
- **Bug Bot Features**:
  - Automatic code analysis
  - PR review integration
  - Security vulnerability detection
  - Performance optimization suggestions

### **Playwright MCP Integration**
- **Purpose**: Enable Claude to interact with browser UIs
- **Benefits**:
  - AI can "see" and test our UI
  - Automated testing generation
  - Browser automation for development workflows
- **Setup**: Configure as MCP server in Cursor settings

## 🎯 Next Immediate Actions

1. **Choose your adventure**: Which excites you most?
   - 🔍 **Explore Open WebUI** - See what's already built
   - 🤖 **Play with Chai.new** - Rapid agent prototyping
   - 🔧 **Set up Langbase SDK** - AI primitives integration
   - 🎭 **Configure Playwright MCP** - Browser automation magic

2. **Quick Decision Points**:
   - Do you have Docker installed for Open WebUI testing?
   - Want to create Langbase account first or explore Chai.new?
   - Should we set up Python virtual environment for SDK work?

## 💡 Development Philosophy

**Build Fast, Iterate Faster**
- ✅ Leverage existing solutions (Open WebUI, Langbase)
- ✅ Prototype rapidly (Chai.new)
- ✅ Test everything (Playwright MCP)
- ✅ Document discoveries
- ✅ Focus on integration over reimplementation
