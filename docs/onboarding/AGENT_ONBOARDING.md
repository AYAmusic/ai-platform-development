### **🔑 Key Technologies & Integrations**

#### **Core Stack**
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) - handles API, WebSockets, data
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit - UI framework (considering React migration)
- **Database**: SQLite (local-first approach)
- **Vector DB**: ChromaDB/FAISS for RAG capabilities

#### **Advanced Integrations**
- **Playwright MCP**: Browser automation via Model Context Protocol
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Console log analysis & error detection
- **Visual Testing**: Screenshot comparison & diff analysis
- **Autonomous Testing**: Self-executing test scenarios

---

## 🎯 **Critical Implementation Details**

### **🤖 Enhanced UI Assistant (`ui_integrated_assistant.py`)**
**This is your primary tool for development work!**

#### **Autonomous Testing Capabilities**
```python
# Example: Test model switching autonomously
await assistant.autonomous_test_feature(
    "Model switching functionality",
    [
        "Click model selector dropdown",
        "Select different model",
        "Send test message",
        "Verify response from new model"
    ]
)
```

#### **Error Analysis System**
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automatically detects error types
- **Fix Suggestions**: Provides actionable solutions
- **Severity Assessment**: Prioritizes critical issues

#### **Visual Diff Analysis**
- **Baseline Capture**: Screenshots before changes
- **Change Detection**: Compares UI states
- **Impact Assessment**: Quantifies visual modifications

### **🔍 Console Monitoring System**
**Real-time insights into application behavior:**
- **Error Detection**: JavaScript, network, authentication issues
- **Performance Monitoring**: Response times, loading states
- **Streaming Analysis**: AI response generation tracking

### **🎛️ Configuration Management**
- **Credentials**: Stored in shell profile for persistence
- **Environment**: Development vs production settings
- **API Keys**: Secure storage and access patterns

---

## 🚀 **Development Workflow**

### **Step 1: Environment Setup**
```bash
# Credentials are already configured
# Virtual environment is ready
# Open WebUI should be running on localhost:3000
```

### **Step 2: Choose Your Approach**
- **UI Testing**: Use `ui_integrated_assistant.py` for browser automation
- **API Testing**: Use `lightweight_api_client.py` for backend validation
- **Monitoring**: Use `dev_assistant_monitor.py` for passive observation

### **Step 3: Autonomous Development Pattern**
1. **Analyze Requirements** - Understand what needs to be built/fixed
2. **Capture Baseline** - Screenshot current state for comparison
3. **Implement Changes** - Write code, modify UI, add features
4. **Test Autonomously** - Use assistant to validate functionality
5. **Analyze Results** - Review error analysis and visual diffs
6. **Iterate** - Refine based on insights
