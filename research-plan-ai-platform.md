## Project Vision & Purpose

### Core Objective
Transform the Open WebUI platform into a bespoke, locally hosted AI application with custom-developed advanced AI capabilities, drawing inspiration from Langbase's "AI primitives" and agent architectures.

### Design Philosophy
- **"Primitives over Frameworks"** - Build with flexible, composable blocks rather than rigid frameworks
- **Local-First** - Operate entirely offline with user privacy and control
- **Modular Architecture** - Composable, interoperable services 
- **Developer-Friendly** - API-first, zero-config where possible

### Target User Experience
Create a user interface achieving excellence comparable to leading commercial AI platforms (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT) while maintaining full local control.

### Development Environment
- **Primary IDE:** Cursor with multiple LLM assistance like Claude 4 Gemini 2.5 etc.
- **Testing:** Playwright for UI automation & MCP integration  
- **Version Control:** GitHub with Bug Bot integration
- **Architecture:** SvelteKit frontend + FastAPI backend (existing Open WebUI structure)

---

## Phase 1: Foundational Analysis & Architectural Blueprint
*Weeks 1-4*

### 1.1 Deconstructing Open WebUI: Understanding the Existing Canvas

#### Current Architecture Assessment (Based on Recent Research)

**Backend (Python/FastAPI):**

## Phase 3: Researching and Planning Custom Advanced AI Capabilities
*Weeks 5-10*

### 3.1 Custom Tooling and Function Calling Implementation

#### Current Open WebUI Capabilities
- Native Python Function Calling Tool
- Pipelines Plugin Framework  
- Tools class with callable methods
- UI-based function addition (need to move to file-based for developer workflow)

#### Playwright MCP Integration
**Model Context Protocol Setup:**
- Playwright configured as MCP server for browser automation
- Integration with Cursor IDE enabling Claude 4 to interact with browsers
- Capabilities: navigation, form filling, testing, UI interaction

**Benefits:**
- AI can "see" and interact with its own UI
- Advanced agentic behaviors beyond typical LLM tool use
- Seamless browser automation for testing and interaction
- **Validated:** Playwright MCP is a stable and actively maintained tool (latest v0.0.28, June 2025). Its use of accessibility trees (default) makes it fast, lightweight, and LLM-friendly without requiring vision models for basic interactions.

### 3.2 Custom RAG System Design

#### RAG Pipeline Components

| Component | Implementation Choice | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Document Loaders** | Open WebUI's built-in loaders (LangChain/LlamaIndex modular components) | Extensive file type support (PDF, TXT, MD, DOCX), already production-ready in Open WebUI |
| **Text Splitters** | Open WebUI's advanced chunking strategies | Token-based chunking with configurable overlap, insights from Langbase chunking parameters + RAG best practices can refine this |
| **Embedding Models** | Local open-source models (via Open WebUI) + Option for external (Langbase) | Privacy-first, no external dependencies for local. Langbase offers 30-50x cost efficiency for hosted options |
| **Vector Stores** | Local SQLite (Open WebUI's default) + support for external (e.g., Pinecone via Open WebUI) | Lightweight, local deployment suitable for core. Pinecone support is already integrated into Open WebUI. |
| **Retrievers** | Open WebUI's hybrid search (BM25 + CrossEncoder re-ranking) | Efficient chunk retrieval based on query embedding, configurable relevance score thresholds. |

#### Integration Requirements
- **Knowledge Base Management UI:** Document upload, management, in-chat selection
- **Clear RAG Indicators:** Visual feedback when RAG is augmenting responses
- **Modular Design:** Use specific library components without adopting entire frameworks

### 3.3 Multimodal Feature Integration

#### Local Multimodal Models (Research Findings)
- **LLaVA Models:** Available through Ollama (7B, 13B, 34B variants)
  - Higher image resolution support (4x more pixels)
  - Improved text recognition and reasoning
  - Apache 2.0 license
- **Gemma 3:** Vision capabilities with local inference
- **Qwen 2.5 VL:** Strong vision-language model
- **Performance Consideration:** While local models are available, their performance (speed and accuracy) can be highly dependent on local hardware. Larger, cloud-hosted multimodal models often offer superior capabilities.

#### Implementation Strategy
- **Primary:** Ollama for robust local serving of vision models
- **Secondary:** WebLLM for potential client-side offloading (for performance optimization)
- **UI Components:** Image upload, multimodal content display, audio playback controls
- **Recommendation:** Proceed with local multimodal model exploration via Ollama, but set realistic expectations for performance and prioritize optimizations for efficient local execution.

### 3.4 Agentic Systems Architecture

#### Workflow Implementation Patterns
1. **Sequential Workflows** (Prompt Chaining)
2. **Conditional Routing** (Agentic Routing)  
3. **Parallel Execution** (Agent Parallelization)
4. **Dynamic Orchestration** (Orchestration-Workers)
5. **Iterative Refinement** (Evaluator-Optimizer)

#### Memory Management
- **Conversation State:** Persistent thread management (leveraging Open WebUI's existing chat history and database).
- **Agent Memory:** Cross-workflow knowledge retention (can leverage Open WebUI's RAG system or Langbase's Memory API for advanced needs).
- **Tool Results:** Caching and reuse of tool outputs (to be implemented via Open WebUI Pipelines).

## Current Research Findings

### Open WebUI Current State (2025)

**Latest Version Capabilities and Recent Updates:**
Open WebUI is under active development with frequent releases (e.g., v0.6.13, v0.6.12, v0.6.11 in May 2025). Key recent additions and improvements include:
*   **Enhanced Model Management:** Support for Azure OpenAI embeddings, smarter custom parameter handling, custom advanced model parameters, parallelized base model fetching, and efficient function loading/caching. New UI indicators for Ollama model status and direct unloading of models.
*   **RAG System Enhancements:** Configurable weight for BM25 in hybrid search, bypass options for embedding/retrieval, and improved source display in non-streaming responses. Support for Pinecone vector database integration.
*   **Tooling and Functions:** Load functions directly from URLs, custom names/descriptions for external tool servers, and custom OpenAPI JSON URL support. Automatic installation of requirements for tools and functions.
*   **User Experience:** Granular audio playback speed control, GZip/Brotli/ZStd compression, AI-enhanced notes with audio transcription, meeting audio recording/import, OneDrive & SharePoint integration, and extensive multilingual support.
*   **Security & Administration:** Granular permissions, audit logs for failed logins, S3 file tagging, OAuth blocked groups support, and configurable notification banners.
*   **Conversational Features:** Dedicated 'Generate Title' button, notification sound options, optimized faster web search (multi-threaded), all-knowledge parallel search, new Firecrawl & Yacy Web Search integrations, and automatic YouTube embed detection.

**Community Feedback on RAG Performance and Limitations:**
*   **Content Ingestion:** Issues with the model "seeing" content are often due to extraction settings; using robust content extraction engines (Apache Tika, Docling) and previewing extracted content are key solutions.
*   **Context Window Limitations:** Many local models (especially Ollama's defaults) are limited to a 2048-token context window, leading to partial content usage. Recommendations include increasing the model's context length (to 8192+ tokens) or using external LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3, Gemini 1.5) with larger context capacities for better RAG performance in production.
*   **Embedding Quality:** Low-quality or mismatched embedding models lead to inaccurate retrieval. Users are advised to switch to high-quality embedding models (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, `Instructor X`, OpenAI embeddings) and reindex documents.
*   **Deep Research Agents:** While Open WebUI supports function calling and pipelines, community discussions reveal that implementing complex, multi-step "deep research" agents (similar to Google Gemini Deep Research or Stanford's STORM) might require significant refactoring of the core `chat_completion` architecture due to its single-execution nature for tools. Some users have successfully integrated external tools like `gpt-researcher` as a pipe function, but issues with real-time progress tracking and API throttling for external search services have been noted.

**Existing Integration Patterns and Extension Examples:**
Open WebUI provides a robust framework for extensions through "Pipelines":
*   **Pipeline Types:** Filters (pre/post-processing), Tools (function calling), Pipes (take over chat flow), and Manifolds (multi-model integration).
*   **Community Contributions:** Examples include status emitters, content filters, saving outputs, and integrations with Azure AI, N8N, Infomaniak, and Google Gemini.

### Langbase SDK Integration Reality Check

**Current API Stability and Pricing Model:**
*   **API Stability:** Langbase is an "API-first platform" with a focus on developer experience, suggesting a stable API. The primary SDK is Node.js/TypeScript.
*   **Pricing:** Offers a "Hobby" (free) tier with limited runs (500/month), limited memory sets (1M Read Units, 100K Write Units, 100 document pages), and 1-hour log retention. A "Custom" enterprise tier offers unlimited features, dedicated support, and advanced capabilities (SSO, compliance, hallucination/cluster engine, rate limiting). Pricing is based on "Pipe Runs" and "Memory Units."

**Real-world Integration Examples and Case Studies:**
*   **Composability:** Langbase emphasizes "Composable AI" with chainable "Pipes" (agents), accelerating product roadmaps by simplifying AI infrastructure.
*   **Key Primitives:** Offers APIs for "Pipe (Agents)," "Memory (RAG)," "Workflow" (multi-step agents), "Threads" (conversation state), "Parser," "Chunker," "Embed," and "Tools" (web crawler, web search via Exa).
*   **Integration Partners:** Integrates with Unified.to (unified API for business integrations) to enable AI applications with customer data.
*   **Customer Stories:** Companies like SiteGPT v2 rebuilt their RAG pipeline using Langbase for "control and accuracy," allowing granular testing and cost optimization.

**Performance Benchmarks for Hybrid Local/Cloud Setups:**
*   Langbase claims "50-100x in-expensive serverless RAG" and "60-90% LLM cost savings" with "Smart Costs Predictions."
*   It supports a "One API for all LLMs" concept, enabling switching between 250+ LLMs, facilitating cost optimization.
*   While promoting serverless cloud deployment, the "Memory (RAG)" and "Tools" primitives suggest a cloud-hosted RAG/tool execution. Direct benchmarks for *hybrid* performance (local Ollama + Langbase RAG) are not explicitly detailed, but cost efficiency claims are compelling for the hosted RAG aspect.

### Chai.new Production Viability

**Actual Deployment Workflows from Prototype to Production:**
*   Chai.new is marketed as a "vibe code any AI agent" platform that "turns prompts into prod-ready agents," deploying to Langbase's serverless infrastructure (Pipes). This implies managed deployment abstracting traditional DevOps.
*   The `chaiverse` (Chai AI developer platform) allows submitting models to their GPU cluster for real-user evaluations, a different "production" path for model developers.

**Integration Capabilities with Existing Platforms:**
*   Chai.new's output (Langbase Pipes) can be integrated via HTTP requests or the Langbase SDK (Node.js).
*   Supports a "One API for all LLMs" and various AI primitives, making it adaptable.
*   Emphasizes "composability," allowing chaining of models and integration with external data sources through Langbase's ecosystem.

**User Experiences and Limitations:**
*   **Ease of Use:** "Vibe code" suggests rapid prototyping and ease of use, even for non-ML experts.
*   **Abstractions:** Provides significant abstractions over underlying AI infrastructure, beneficial for rapid development but limiting granular control for highly customized local deployments.
*   **Cloud Dependency:** Agents built on Chai.new are deployed to Langbase's cloud. For "local-first" deployment, agent logic from Chai.new would need re-implementation or interaction with the cloud-hosted Langbase Pipe.

### Technical Stack Validation

**Svelte vs React for Complex UI Components (Node Editors, Dashboards):**
*   **Open WebUI's Current Stack:** Svelte/SvelteKit.
*   **Svelte Advantages:** Superior performance (bundle size, load time, DOM updates), streamlined developer experience (less boilerplate, intuitive reactivity), and built-in features (state management, transitions). Excellent for high-performance, sleek apps and interactive visuals.
*   **React Advantages:** Massive ecosystem, extensive UI component libraries, larger talent pool, proven in large-scale complex applications.
*   **Conclusion:** Svelte's performance and DX benefits justify its retention and enhancement within Open WebUI. For complex components like node editors, leveraging Svelte-native solutions or community ports (e.g., `shadcn-svelte`) will be prioritized.

**MCP + Playwright Current Stability and Adoption:**
*   **Purpose:** Playwright MCP Server enables LLMs to interact with web pages via structured accessibility snapshots (default) or vision mode (screenshots). Allows multiple clients to connect to a single Playwright instance.
*   **Stability:** Stable and actively maintained by Microsoft (@playwright/mcp npm package, latest v0.0.28, June 2025).
*   **Adoption:** Integrated with AI clients like VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Desktop.
*   **Benefits:** Fast, lightweight, LLM-friendly, deterministic tool application. Supports remote debugging, shared testing, and performance testing.
*   **Limitations for AI-generated Code:** AI-generated Playwright code often needs human review due to suboptimal locators, lack of business logic nuance, redundancy, simplistic assertions, and potential disregard for best practices.

**Local Multimodal Model Performance Benchmarks:**
*   **Available Models (via Ollama):** LLaVA (7B, 13B, 34B with improved resolution/text recognition), Gemma 3 (vision capabilities), Qwen 2.5 VL.
*   **Performance:** Highly hardware-dependent. Performance for complex tasks might not match larger cloud models.
*   **Optimization Strategies:** "Model optimization" and "WebLLM for potential client-side offloading" are key mitigation strategies. Open WebUI's RAG troubleshooting suggests local model context limits are a bottleneck, often recommending external models for production-grade RAG.

### Competitive Analysis

**Similar Open Source Local AI Platforms:**
*   **Jan (jan.ai):** Open-source ChatGPT-alternative, 100% offline. Features local LLM inferencing, model hub, OpenAI-compatible local API server, experimental RAG ("Chat with your files"), and planned "Assistants & Memory" and "Extensions." Emphasizes local-first, user-owned data, and customizability.
*   **LocalAI (localai.io):** Free, open-source OpenAI/Anthropic alternative for local LLMs, image/audio generation, and autonomous agents. OpenAI API compatible drop-in replacement. Includes "LocalAGI" (autonomous agents) and "LocalRecall" (semantic search/memory). Prioritizes privacy, no GPU required for basic use.
*   **Open WebUI (Our project base):** Already a strong contender with mature built-in RAG, Python-based Pipelines, and a user-friendly chat interface.

**Key Similarities and Differences:**
*   All three share a local-first, privacy-focused vision for AI.
*   All support local LLM inference and some form of RAG/tooling.
*   Open WebUI: Strongest built-in RAG and Python-based extensibility framework. Focus on UI/UX.
*   Jan: Desktop app experience, user-owned data focus, future plans for assistants/memory.
*   LocalAI: OpenAI API compatibility, integrated stack for agents and RAG within its ecosystem.

**Commercial Alternatives to be Aware Of:**
*   **Cloud-based LLM Platforms (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT):** Offer superior model performance, scalability, advanced multimodal/agent capabilities, but compromise data privacy and incur ongoing API fees. Serve as UX benchmarks for our local-first goal.
*   **Langchain/LlamaIndex:** Frameworks for building AI apps, offering modularity for underlying AI logic.
*   **Managed AI Platforms (AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform, Azure ML):** Cloud-native, scalable ML platforms; not for local-first use.
*   **Hosted Vector Database Providers (Pinecone, ChromaDB, Weaviate):** Commercial services for vector storage; our project prioritizes local options.

## Strategic Refinements

Based on the comprehensive research, the following strategic refinements will guide our development:

1.  **Prioritize Open WebUI's Native RAG System:** Maximize the use of Open WebUI's advanced, built-in RAG capabilities. Focus development effort on refining its UI/UX, guiding users on optimal model context settings for RAG, and exploring advanced retrieval techniques within this existing framework rather than building a parallel RAG system.
2.  **Hybrid RAG Strategy with Clear Criteria:** While local-first remains core, define clear criteria for when Langbase's hosted Memory (RAG) service might be beneficial (e.g., for very large knowledge bases, specialized retrieval needs, or scenarios where its claimed cost efficiency for high-volume RAG is critical). This offers a flexible, performance-aware option without compromising the local-first principle for core data.
3.  **Agentic Workflow Implementation via Open WebUI Pipelines:** Implement complex, multi-step AI capabilities and agentic architectures (Augmented LLM, Prompt Chaining, Agentic Routing, etc.) predominantly as sophisticated "Pipe" pipelines within Open WebUI's existing Python-based extensibility framework. This leverages the platform's modularity and maintains local control over agent logic and execution.
4.  **Chai.new as a Rapid Prototyping Tool:** Utilize Chai.new primarily for rapid prototyping and "vibe coding" of agent logic and prompts. Acknowledge that for local-first deployment, successful agent designs from Chai.new would be translated and implemented within Open WebUI's native pipeline framework, or interact with cloud-hosted Langbase Pipes as per the hybrid RAG strategy.
5.  **UI/UX for Competitive Differentiation:** Given the emergence of other open-source local AI platforms (Jan, LocalAI), a superior and intuitive UI/UX for building, managing, and interacting with custom agents and complex workflows will be a key differentiator. Prioritize the development of a user-friendly node-based editor and advanced dashboards.
6.  **Commitment to SvelteKit Frontend:** Continue to leverage SvelteKit for the frontend. Invest in identifying or developing robust Svelte-native UI components for complex features to maintain performance advantages and a cohesive development experience.

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **Complexity of Custom AI Primitives** - Mitigation: Modular architecture, comprehensive testing
2. **Performance of Local Models** - Mitigation: Model optimization, WebLLM offloading, clear UI feedback
3. **UI/UX Parity Challenge** - Mitigation: Dedicated design time, user testing, leveraging Svelte's strengths and exploring modern Svelte component libraries.
4. **Integration Complexity** - Mitigation: Thorough documentation, standardized patterns.
5. **Open WebUI Architectural Limitations for Deep Agents:** The current `chat_completion` architecture in Open WebUI primarily executes tasks once, potentially limiting truly dynamic, multi-turn, self-correcting "deep research" agents within a single interaction without complex workarounds.
    *   **Mitigation:** Investigate if Open WebUI's "Channels" feature offers a more suitable architectural pattern for persistent, multi-turn agent execution. Design agentic workflows carefully within the capabilities of the Pipelines framework.
6. **Developer Bandwidth for Svelte UI Components:** Developing complex UI elements (e.g., node editors, advanced analytics dashboards) in Svelte from scratch or adapting community ports can be resource-intensive, especially given the smaller Svelte talent pool compared to React.
    *   **Mitigation:** Allocate sufficient dedicated frontend development resources. Prioritize core UI/UX for agent workflows and iterate on advanced dashboards. Foster community contributions if feasible.

### Strategic Risks  
1. **Scope Creep** - Mitigation: Strict adherence to phased implementation
2. **Technology Bet Risks** - Mitigation: Modular design allowing component swapping
3. **Community/Ecosystem Maturity** - Mitigation: Leverage established tools where possible
4. **Data Synchronization in Hybrid RAG Scenarios:** If a hybrid RAG approach is adopted (combining local Open WebUI RAG with hosted Langbase Memory), ensuring seamless data synchronization, consistency, and efficient routing between the two knowledge bases will be a complex challenge.
    *   **Mitigation:** Define clear data governance policies and synchronization mechanisms. Develop robust routing logic to determine which knowledge base to query based on data type, sensitivity, or user preference.
5. **Long-term Viability/Cost of Hosted Service Dependencies:** Relying on Langbase for core agent orchestration or RAG in a hybrid model introduces a dependency on a third-party service, its API stability, and its pricing model. Scaling could incur significant costs, potentially challenging the "local-first" and "user privacy/control" philosophy.
    *   **Mitigation:** Continuously monitor Langbase pricing and evaluate if critical Langbase-dependent features could eventually be open-sourced or replicated locally if costs become prohibitive or full independence is desired.
6. **Integration Complexity between Different AI Primitives:** Combining Open WebUI's native RAG and tools with Langbase's Pipes, Workflows, and Memory (especially given potential differences in underlying technologies or paradigms) will require careful design to ensure seamless interoperability and a cohesive developer experience.
    *   **Mitigation:** Establish clear API contracts and data models for the integration layer. Document the hybrid architecture meticulously to reduce complexity and facilitate future maintenance.

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Integration Strategy:** Should we integrate Langbase SDK directly into Open WebUI's backend, or create a bridge service that connects the two platforms?

2. **Langbase vs Local RAG:** When should we use Open WebUI's built-in RAG vs Langbase's hosted Memory service? What are the tradeoffs?

3. **Chai.new Workflow:** How can we best leverage Chai.new for rapid agent prototyping while maintaining local control?

4. **UI Enhancement Focus:** Given Open WebUI's robust backend capabilities, should we focus primarily on enhancing the UI/UX layer with modern components?

5. **Agent Orchestration:** Should we build workflow orchestration on top of Open WebUI's existing pipelines, or integrate Langbase's Workflow primitives?

6. **Development Philosophy:** Are we building a "better Open WebUI" or a "local Langbase alternative" - and how does this affect our architectural decisions?

7. **Tool Integration:** How can we combine Open WebUI's existing tool system with Langbase's pre-built tools (web search, crawling)?
